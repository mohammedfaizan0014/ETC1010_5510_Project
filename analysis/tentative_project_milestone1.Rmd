# Project and Data Description

## The LinkedIn-World Bank Digital Data for Development:Industry Jobs and Skills Trends

"The World Bank Group and LinkedIn have created the Digital Data for Development collaboration to support innovative policy decisions as developing countries grapple with a rapidly changing global economy. With hundreds of millions of members worldwide, LinkedIn has the potential to offer a new, timely, and granular source of data about emerging industries, workers’ changing skills composition and how they’re engaging with labor markets globally." ~ [1](https://linkedindata.worldbank.org/about)

This collaboration enables government and policy makers to drive better polciy implementations and thus creating opportunities to the global work force. The data represents LinkedIn members' data based on four metrics: Industry Employment Shifts, Talent Migration, Industry Skills Needs, Skills Penetration. The records in the data are spread over 140 countries having a distribution across six major industry sectors: Financial Services, Professional Services, Information & Communication Technology (ICT), the Arts & Creative Industries, Manufacturing, and Mining/Quarrying and possessing skills within the over 50,000 distinct, standardized skills classified by LinkedIn into 249 skill groups, further categorised as: Business Skills, Disruptive Tech Skills, Soft Skills, Specialized Industry Skills and Tech Skills.  

In our project, we will be working on the following questions.
