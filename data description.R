Question2:What is the average percentage of 
net migration for each industry over the past 
five years and Is the growth rate of immigration 
within the industry related to the growth rate 
of the industry?

olddata

In the first part of my question data 
migration_industry (5,295 × 30) is used. 
The variables industry and industry section's 
name,id net migration rate per year is chosen, 
renamed, and change format final(26,475×4). 
In the second part of the question  
original data is 3_Employment_Growth 
(14,144 ×13). I picked industry id, name 
and the rate of industry's improvement in each 
year. I use industry_id and year are used as
the key to connect the two tables, 
final(380×5).
